I bought this because I loved the trial for the birthday gift last year--- which lasted AGES (like 4 months); bought this and thought that it would last a long time, ended up being <6 months. Also didn't seem as creamy as the trial version (could just be me!). Bummed. Really wanted this to work and last, but wasn't impressed enough to purchase again.\",\n",

The only downside is the price and the amount of product. I bought this in early March and it finished The last day of May, so roughly 3 months for $68... But I will be repurchasing bc I just used cetahpil face lotion today and my face looks like I’ve been running a marathon :(\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product',\n",

When I tried the Protini Polypeptide Cream I instantly liked it. I loved how it got on my skin and got absorbed. Then when I finished using the trial size, bought a full size during one of the sales. I really like the dispensing system. I like the fact that my hands don't go directly into the container and it dispenses how much I should use.

       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nAMAZING\\nThis moisturizer is amazing! It’s light and doesn’t make me break out. My boyfriend loves it as well. It’s pricey but this is definitely worth every penny!\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  \"28 Apr 2020\\nThe moisturizer works best for me when applied in the morning after washing my face with water and before putting on makeup. I have seen a slight difference in skin improvement over using just my regular cetaphil lotion on my face. The consistency is a little thin so I don't wear it at night. I need something a little thicker at night, as my face still feels dry after applying this after face wash.\\nRecommends this product\",\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nnot for my dry skin\\nI’ve heard such great things about this moisturizer so when it was a point perk I had to grab it. If was just okay though. It was a much thinner and lighter moisturizer than I was expecting and did nothing for my drier skin. I think I would have really liked this when my skin was oily (pre use of retinol) but after every use I would wake up with dry patches.\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  \"28 Apr 2020\\nI hate that I love this moisturizer so much (because $$$). I have dry skin that gets extra dry in winter, so I used to buy a light summer moisturizer and heavy-duty winter moisturizer — this is an all-in-one solution. It's lightweight (aka not heavy and oily) yet extremely hydrating. There's no cons with this product — a neutral, natural smell; layers well under make-up; absorbs well; effective. I like the unique packaging too. It gives you just enough product with every pump.\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product\",\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nThe price is high for this item, but when it’s combined with the jelly cleanser it is phenomenal. It hurts my bank account but it does wonders to my face, so I will be repurchasing.\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nIt’s Alright...\\nI received this in my birthday gift last year. The results were okay, but the cream felt oily and much too thick for my liking. I have pretty dry skin and I think that’s what this moisturizer is made for, but it still felt greasy. I used the whole sample, but wouldn’t purchase the full size, not for $68.',\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nMeh\\nreceived it in a birthday perk set from sephora, used it up and enjoyed it. it didn’t make any difference in my skin other than just moisturizing and I have normal skin, I don’t think it would work for oily or extremely dry skin types. This and the cleanser that came in the birthday set were first products I tried from DE and I am not impressed, for the price of full size I would expect wonders on my skin.\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nBest moisturizer for summer! LOVE this product for summer or when I travel to hot/humid climate countries. It is not rich enough for my skin during the winter though.\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nBreak out city. Too greasy.\\nPass. It\\'s supposedly \"clean\" but it made my skin breakout all over my chin. I know it was this product, because the minute I stopped using it, the breakouts went away. I didn\\'t change anything else in my skin routine, which is really just micellar water for cleansing and jojoba oil for moisturizing.',\n",
       "  \"Verified Purchase\\n28 Apr 2020\\nProtini vs Tatcha Water Cream for Sensitive Skin\\nAs a newbie in the skincare game (literally coming from using Dove sensitive skin body wash and drugstore moisturizer on my face), I spent DAYS researching products. I combed through reviews, spent hours watching Beauty Within on youtube, and read through dozens of 'Best of' lists from top beauty companies. I was looking for something with little to no fragrance, a lighter formula, and gentle active ingredients. My skin is dry/ combination but very sensitive. I decided to give two of the best-known moisturizers for sensitive skin a chance: Drunk Elephant Protini and Tatcha The Water Cream. Protini is one of the best things I've ever placed on my face! I love the portion control aspect of the applicator, and the texture is light and creamy. It absorbs within minutes and leaves my skin feeling baby soft right after application and all day/night after. When I go to wash my face next, I can still feel the velvety softness of the moisturizer under my fingers as I'm wetting my face for my cleanser. It is truly fragrance free, and I can't stop touching my face after I apply this stuff- Its seriously magic. The Tatcha Water Cream has a wonderful, magical feeling as it converts from a light cream to a water right on your face. However, I noticed that it takes a LONG time (upwards of 20 minutes) for that slippery watery cream to fully absorb into my skin where I don't feel it coming off on my fingers if I touch my face. It feels heavier and greasier on my skin until it fully absorbs, and it doesn't have the same 'still there' feeling when I go to wash my face next. It does have a slight, light natural fragrance to it that is pleasant and un-irritating, but it is something to note. It is also much messier to apply- it comes with a little golden spoon to help you scoop some product out of the gar in a hygeinic-portion controlled way, but I always seem to get product on the rim of the jar or all over the lid. Overall: both are amazing, but Protini definitely wins out for me!\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product\",\n",
       "  '28 Apr 2020\\nbleh moisturiser... packaging not recyclable :(\\nDoesn’t moisturise enough despite dealing a little greasy/heavy on the skin I even used it in conjunction with their oil and moisture ‘boosting’ products like ‘bhydra intensive moisturising serum’. Skin still feels like it needs more and it doesn’t with other products. ALSO, this is a big negative for me their containers with ALL OF THE PLASTIC THEY USE and received awards for are not recyclable. I don’t know how people can bring new plastic in the world and not even allow it to be recycled. Two words: Pacific Gyre. Finally, while my skin isn’t dry by any means using this product allowed some of the wrinkles I have been beating back to resurface. I will go back to tatcha.\\n…read more',\n",
       "  '27 Apr 2020\\nmeh\\nI received a sample of this and while it is a great moisturizer I hated the way that it absorbed into my skin, especially at night. It felt very heavy and I prefer moisturizers that absorb more into the skin.',\n",
       "  \"Verified Purchase\\n27 Apr 2020\\nLove this. Staple in collection\\nLOVE this product. It literally saved my face when it was acting out. I got a weird rash on one side during the winter that literally nothing was working. I received a sample for my birthday 2 years ago. This thing literally made majority of the rash go away overnight. Apart from that situation it leaves my skin moisturized and gives me a nice glow. Isn't greasy. Now i'm on my second bottle. It's become a staple.\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product\",\n",
       "  \"27 Apr 2020\\nJust okay.\\nThis isn't for me. I have dry, sensitive skin, and I thought this would be the lifesaving holy grail moisturizer of my dreams. It has a nice texture and didn't irritate my skin, but didn't seem moisturizing enough. The 9 polypeptides didn't seem to do much but sit on my skin. It wasn't /bad/, but for the price, it seemed to do the same thing as an aveeno moisturizer or something else drugstore and underwhelming. I ended up returning it, too expensive to not really do anything for me.\\n…read more\",\n",
