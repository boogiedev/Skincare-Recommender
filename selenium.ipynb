       "  \"Verified Purchase\\n28 Apr 2020\\nDrunk Elephant Protini vs Tatcha Water Cream\\nAs a newbie in the skincare game (literally coming from using Dove sensitive skin body wash and drugstore moisturizer on my face), I spent DAYS researching products. I combed through reviews, spent hours watching Beauty Within on youtube, and read through dozens of 'Best of' lists from top beauty companies. I was looking for something with little to no fragrance, a lighter formula, and gentle active ingredients. My skin is dry/ combination but very sensitive. I decided to give two of the best-known moisturizers for sensitive skin a chance: Drunk Elephant Protini and Tatcha The Water Cream. Protini is one of the best things I've ever placed on my face! I love the portion control aspect of the applicator, and the texture is light and creamy. It absorbs within minutes and leaves my skin feeling baby soft right after application and all day/night after. When I go to wash my face next, I can still feel the velvety softness of the moisturizer under my fingers as I'm wetting my face for my cleanser. It is truly fragrance free, and I can't stop touching my face after I apply this stuff- Its seriously magic. The Tatcha Water Cream has a wonderful, magical feeling as it converts from a light cream to a water right on your face. However, I noticed that it takes a LONG time (upwards of 20 minutes) for it to fully absorb into my skin where I don't feel it coming off on my fingers if I touch my face. It feels heavier and greasier on my skin until it fully absorbs, and it doesn't have the same 'still there' feeling when I go to wash my face later, making me think its just too lightweight for me. Its application is also messier- it comes with a little golden spoon to help you scoop some product out of the jar in a hygienic,portion-controlled way, but I always seem to get product on the rim of the jar or all over the lid. Otherwise, its smell is light and pleasant and it did its job of lightweight moisturizing. Overall: both are amazing, but Protini definitely wins out for me!\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product\",\n",

I can't give this one up and will repurchase, again and again. I tried switching but my breakouts came back, went back to this and they cleared again! My skin has been so much better because of all the benfits this gives as well! I do have oily skin so this was the perfect match for me.

I break out if I use any ol moisturizer. This is the second time I have bought this tatcha water cream. It’s a jelly substance, that has a boujee spoon to dip it out onto your face, so it doesn’t get contaminated. I love that. Smells amazing. Geisha skin care. I love it. My skin soaks this up, and always gives me a beautiful glow. If you want a preventive, anti-aging, light water gel moisturizer, I highly recommend this. One of the best ones out there for oily skin if you ask me. I never buy the same thing over and over UNLESS it works. This works, and the price tag is hefty, but the little spoon keeps you from using too much if used correctly. I take the spoon and tap dots of it all over my face, neck, décolletage and then pay it in. It’s worth it.\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product',\n",

It feels amazing on my skin, it’s great under makeup or before bedtime and what I love most about it is it’s lightweight, doesn’t feel sticky or tacky and it makes my skin so soft!! I wish it was a bit less but in pretty sure I’ll end up buying the full sized one soon\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '20 d ago\\nTravel size has a big air bubble\\nI like this well enough, really nice before makeup. Bought the trial size despite it being 1/5 the size but 1/3 the cost. I guess I didn’t compare the containers but when I dig into the container there was a big air bubble so the product would sit beautifully on top but it was a lie. Probably enough to use about 10 times. Really dishonest way to do it, tbh. Not going to purchase a full size.',\n",
       "  '20 d ago\\nThis is my absolute holy grail! Love this moisturizer, paired with youth to the people cleanser & boom, clear skin for me. The Absolute BEST. other products from tatcha are ehh except the cleansing oil, that’s good too!\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '20 d ago\\nDidn’t work for me\\nI have dry combination skin and I much prefer tatcha’s dewy skin cream. I found the consistency/texture of this to be tacky and sticky and it sat on top of my skin and didn’t really absorb at all. My face looked so shiny and not in a good way. Returned after five uses.',\n",
       "  \"20 d ago\\nNOT for acne prone skin\\nI purchased this product with points, hoping to love it. I heard nothing but good reviews on it from people with similar skin types to me. The texture was great, smell was great, it absorbed ok but felt a little greasy on my oily skin. I used it for 2 days- the only change I made in my skincare/makeup routine. Woke up on the 3rd day with SIX cysts on my face- which isn't normal. Did a little research online and found that others with acne prone skin had the same issue.\\n…read more\",\n",
       "  '20 d ago\\nI wanted to love this moisturizer, but it really doesn’t hydrate my skin that well. I received it as a sample but I won’t purchase it. Otherwise, it feels nice and cool when putting onto my face and neck, and it has a lovely fresh smell.',\n",
       "  '20 d ago\\nI was adding sample sized versions of this to orders frequently—even ordering other stuff when I was about to run out just for the sample version!—because I often have bad experiences with popular/“designer”-type skin products (vs drug store aveeno, etc) and I wanted to be totally sure this wasn’t gonna sneak you and ruin my skin and be unusable before I spent the $. I love it so much though, for the summer when my normal facial moisturizer feels thick and like it’ll never sink in, feeling like a layer of sweat or something that won’t go away, this one is so light and I don’t feel it sitting on my skin it seems to sink in immediately. No breakouts or bad reactions on my quite sensitive skin, not sure about benefits outside of moisturizing yet—nothing noticeable, but I do love it as my morning moisturizer for spring and summer!\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product',\n",

       "  '21 d ago\\nLovvvveee\\nI love this moisturizer! it makes my skin feel moisturized, but not sticky. Ive seen a visible difference since ive started using this cream in my pore visibility, texture, and overall complexion . My skin is super oily, and this seems to keep the oiliness at bay. highly recommend!\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  'Verified Purchase\\n21 d ago\\nYOU NEED TO GET THIS!\\nLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Pores minimized after two uses (used with the cleanser). Oh-my-God! Totally worth the price tag. The full size lasts about two months (using day and night for two people).\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '22 d ago\\nbasically greasy perfume\\nThe attractive packaging is deceiving as this product doesn’t do much on delivery. I have sensitive and acne prone skin and need good, long lasting hydration on my skin. I used this product in tandem with the facial cleanser for 12 days before giving up. This moisturizers biggest issue for me was that it was heavily scented. Right behind that, I found that this moisturizer doesn’t spread well and was slightly greasy even after my skin had time to absorb. Overall, this product was not for me, I want unscented and non greasy with easy coverage for ease and this did not deliver that, unfortunately. Beautiful packaging otherwise.\\n…read more',\n",

       "  '22 d ago\\nThis is one of the best water creams available. Will instantly help your skin with any dryness and is super light. I am oily skin so I use it as a moisturizer by itself most of the time and if i do prime with it I have to use the Fenty Mattifying primer on top of it so that I have half of chance of making it through the day.\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '22 d ago\\nBEST CREAM EVER!\\nI wish I could give this cream 10 stars. I have an oily t zone and the rest of my face is fairly normal. I would notice, however, if I used creams that were too thick or oily, I would break out. I used to use Belif’s aqua bomb which I loved due to its texture but I found that even after it dried, it left my skin feeling dewy and kinda sticky. Water cream doesn’t do that to me! Literally feels like I’m putting water on my face but when it dries, you can’t see it. It’s like it melts into your skin and makes you feel soft. Within 3 days of using, I saw a difference. I had broken out due to another moisturizer and Tatcha is helping repair my skin! Yes, it’s pricy, but it’s worth it!\\n…read more\\nRecommends this product',\n",
       "  '22 d ago\\nFast absorbing but not hydrating enough\\nI’ve been meaning to try this out for awhile now since I read some great reviews on it, but this product isn’t for me. It’s a nice product that absorbed into my skin really quickly, but it wasn’t hydrating enough for my combination skin so I had to go back to my old moisturizer.',\n",
       "  '22 d ago\\nVery light. Doesn’t work for my skin.\\nHasn’t done any good to my skin so far Hasn’t done any good to my skin so far. I received this product a week ago and ever since I’ve been using it day and night. More than half of the jar has emptied with zero benefits to my skin.'])"
